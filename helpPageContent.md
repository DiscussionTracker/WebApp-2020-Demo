##### Argument Moves

Because argumentation is so central to academic communication, DT provides information on three important "moves" students make while arguing their perspectives.

###### Claim

The basic arguable statement ("Lady Macbeth is responsible for the murder of King Duncan")

###### Evidence

Support for the arguable statement, could be textual or could be experiential-- ("You see how she directly prays for the spirits to make her more callous in Act 1 when she says "fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty!")

###### Explanation

Connecting the evidence back to the claim-- ("This is the very definition of pre-meditation-- she is literally preparing herself to murder. This would totally count as evidence in a criminal case.")
