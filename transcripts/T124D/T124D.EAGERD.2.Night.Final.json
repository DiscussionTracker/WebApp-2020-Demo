That's what he wants you to<BR/> do, that's why it's first person! That's why he<BR/> is the protagonist and the survivor and the<BR/> author- it's all intentional. He wants you to<BR/> experience it as awful as you possibly can, so<BR/> that you know how bad it is. So we made a comment<BR/> yesterday, \"no survivor could begin to tell a<BR/> spark of the flame of the story\", right? So even<BR/> though we're never gonna understand it<BR/> completely or be able to put ourselves in the<BR/> shoes completely, put yourselves in his shoes<BR/> as much as you possibly can, because if you know<BR/> how bad it was and you're feeling these emotions<BR/> that Elie makes you feel, then you're not gonna<BR/> let something like this happen. Like I told you,<BR/> you guys are the future, you guys are gonna grow<BR/> up and you have to be the ones who don't hate, who<BR/> don't discriminate, those of you- you guys all<BR/> have to be the ones who are accepting of tolerant<BR/> and teach your friends and your children those<BR/> things so that nothing like this ever happens<BR/> again.
